Basic Outline of Project Steps:
1. Learn C# to apply in Unity 
2. Make prototype map 
3. Implement basic RNG (randomized stats, damage, etc)
4. Implement unique stages
5. Implement "crude" AI
6. Implement a proper inventory system
7. Graphics (general UI, character models, etc)
8. Add extra features such as sounds, abilities. Polish exisiting features as well

Rubric:

20 points - (Steps 2 & 3) Implement proper base of the game
15 points - (Steps 4, 5, and 6) Added extra features that contribute to the complexity of the game 
5 points - (Steps 7 & 8) Basic graphics and sounds 

Time Log: 

Spent 3-4 hours every weekend dedicated to practicing C# and learning the Unity Environment. 
- Total = 9-12 hours. 
- See Hackkerank-Practice folder for examples.
- Note that more work than what's in the folder was done, but Hackerrank doesn't save every attempt (atleast I think) so the ones I have there are redone from scratch.
