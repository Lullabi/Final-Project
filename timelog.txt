Time Log

Calvin Specific
---------------
Spent 3-4 hours every weekend dedicated to practicing C# and learning the Unity Environment. 
- Total = 9-12 hours. 
- See Hackkerank-Practice folder for examples.
- Note that more work than what's in the folder was done, but Hackerrank doesn't save every attempt (atleast I think) so the ones I have there are redone from scratch.

10/30 (1 hour) - Looked over various map-building tools in unity like grids, tilemaps, and sprites
- Just a solo meeting so no discussion, just looked at tutorials and all that.

10/30 (1 hour) - Met with a friend to talk art ideas, drew concept art, and other concepts
- We talked enemy design, boss design, background design.
- Landed on the idea that all backgrounds should look the same but with various color for efficiency sake
- Enemies based on "RNG" games. (Coin enemy = coin flip, Dice enemy = dice roll, etc)
